User notes
 - she typed 't' for trig and it did not work (would have typed 'p' for pythagoras)
- she typed 'l' for length and it did not work
- she did not know which trip option to use (sin / cos / tan) - said she had an angle and one of the sides <the opposite>
- she typed 'h' for hypotenuse


note:
maybe don't show N/A and calculate the thing that's not given?
